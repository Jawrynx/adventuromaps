STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE: Add Test Exploration to Firestore
============================================================

IMPORTANT: Remove the "instructions" field from exploration items.
Exploration documents do NOT have an "instructions" field.
Only WAYPOINTS have instructions.

============================================================
STEP 1: Create the Main Exploration Document
============================================================

1. Open Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Go to your project > Firestore Database
3. Click on "explorations" collection (or create it if it doesn't exist)
4. Click "Add document"
5. Set document ID to "AUTO-ID"
6. Add these EXACT fields:

Field Name       | Type      | Value
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
categories       | array     | "Distance Testing", "Demo Mode", "Development"
createdAt        | timestamp | [Click timestamp icon, use current date/time]
description      | string    | Test exploration covering various distance ranges: very close (<400m), close (400m-2km), medium (2-8km), long (8-50km), very long (50-200km), and extreme (>200km) to test loading screen timing.
difficulty       | string    | Easy
estimatedTime    | string    | 30 minutes
image_url        | string    | [leave empty]
keyLocations     | array     | "London Eye", "Big Ben", "Tower Bridge", "Buckingham Palace", "Oxford", "Birmingham", "Manchester", "Edinburgh"
name             | string    | Distance Range Test Route
publishedAt      | timestamp | [Click timestamp icon, use current date/time]
status           | string    | published
subDescription   | string    | Tests all distance ranges for cinematic panning transition timing validation.
type             | string    | exploration

7. Click "Save"
8. Note the auto-generated document ID - you'll need it for the next steps

============================================================
STEP 2: Create Routes Subcollection
============================================================

For EACH of the 6 routes below, do this:

1. Click on the exploration document you just created
2. Click "Start collection" (if first route) or "Add document" (for subsequent routes)
3. Collection ID: "routes"
4. Document ID: "AUTO-ID"
5. Add the fields shown below for each route
6. Click "Save"

--- ROUTE 1: London Eye → Big Ben (~350m) ---
Field: order (number) = 1
Field: coordinates (array) = 
  [0] (map)
    - lat (number): 51.5033
    - lng (number): -0.1195

============================================================
STEP 3: Create Waypoints for Each Route

1. Click on the route document
2. Click "Start collection"
3. Collection ID: "waypoints"
4. Document ID: "AUTO-ID"
5. Add waypoint fields (shown below)
6. Repeat for all waypoints in that route

============================================================
STEP 4: Verify
============================================================

Your Firestore structure should look like:

explorations/
  └── [auto-generated-id]/
      ├── categories: [array]
      ├── createdAt: [timestamp]
      ├── description: [string]
      ├── difficulty: "Easy"
      ├── estimatedTime: "30 minutes"
      ├── image_url: ""
      ├── keyLocations: [array]
      ├── name: "Distance Range Test Route"
      ├── publishedAt: [timestamp]
      ├── status: "published"
      ├── subDescription: [string]
      ├── type: "exploration"
      │
      └── routes/ (subcollection)
          ├── [route-1-id]/
          │   ├── order: 1
          │   ├── coordinates: [array of lat/lng maps]
          │   └── waypoints/ (subcollection)
          │       ├── [waypoint-1-id]/
          │       │   ├── description, image, instructions, keyframes,
          │       │   ├── lat, lng, name, narration, order
          │       └── [waypoint-2-id]/
          │           └── [same fields]
          │
          ├── [route-2-id]/
          │   └── ...
          │
          ... (routes 3-6)

============================================================
STEP 5: Test
============================================================

1. Refresh your app
2. Navigate to the Explore view
3. You should see "Distance Range Test Route"
4. Click on it to open Demo Mode
5. Test the waypoint transitions and observe the loading screen timing

============================================================
TIP: Quick Entry Method
============================================================

To speed things up:
1. Create Route 1 completely with waypoints
2. Use Firebase Console's "Duplicate" feature (three dots menu)
3. Duplicate the route and modify the coordinates/waypoints
4. This is faster than creating from scratch each time!
