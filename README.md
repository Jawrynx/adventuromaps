**For Developers wishing to help development**

To get the app up and running on your local machine from this repository, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js & npm:** You'll need Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
  ```bash
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

- **Firebase Project:** Set up your own Firebase project with:
  - Firestore Database (for storing adventures, routes, waypoints)
  - Firebase Storage (for images, audio files, keyframes)
  - Web app configuration for firebaseConfig variables

- **Google Maps API:** You'll need a Google Maps JavaScript API key with:
  - Maps JavaScript API enabled
  - A custom Map ID for styling

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jawrynx/adventuromaps.git
   cd adventuromaps
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Firebase config:
   ```env
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   ```

4. **Google Maps Setup:**
   - Update `src/core/layout/App.jsx` with your Google Maps API key in the APIProvider
   - Update `src/core/layout/MainContent.jsx` with your custom Map ID in the mapProps useMemo

5. **Database Structure:**
   Set up Firestore collections with this structure:
   ```
   adventure/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [adventure_id]/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routes/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [route_id]/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ waypoints/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [waypoint_id]
   exploration/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [exploration_id]/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routes/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [route_id]/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ waypoints/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [waypoint_id]
   ```

6. **Media Files Setup:**
   For demo mode features, waypoints should include:
   - `image_urls`: Array of image URLs
   - `narration_url`: URL to audio file (MP3/WAV)
   - `keyframes_url`: URL to keyframes text file (format: `timestamp:text`)

7. **Test the setup:**
   Try creating an Adventure/Exploration item through the admin interface!

### Development Commands

- **Development mode:** `npm start` - Opens the Electron app with hot reload
- **Build for production:** `npm run build` - Creates production build
- **Preview build:** `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally

### Keyframes Format for Narration üéµ

For synchronized text highlighting with audio narration, create keyframes files with this format:

```
0.1:This is a test
1.2:of something
1.8:that will go in the
2.8:description box!
```

- **Format:** `timestamp:text_to_highlight`
- **Timestamp:** Seconds into the audio (decimal supported)
- **Text:** Exact text from waypoint description to highlight
- **File Type:** Plain text file (.txt) hosted on Firebase Storage

The system will automatically:
1. Parse keyframes when demo mode starts
2. Segment waypoint descriptions into highlightable spans
3. Highlight text in real-time as audio plays
4. Provide smooth transitions between highlighted segments

### Usage

This command will open the Adventuro Maps desktop app, ready for you to explore and develop!
